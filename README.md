## Bikeability

_Rating the bikeability of Albuquerque neighborhoods_

Using data sourced from the city of Albuquerque and possibly the public, the idea behind _bikeability_ is to rate how bikeable different parts of the city are.

This project will evolve as we go. We are starting with a minimum vision of determining the number of bike lanes / paths / trails / boulevards through each square mile zone of Albuquerque.

We'll see what happens from there.
